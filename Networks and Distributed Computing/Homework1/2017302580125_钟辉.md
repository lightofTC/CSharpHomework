**P3. Consider an application that transmits data at a steady rate (for example, the sender generates an N-bit unit of data every k time units, where k is small and fixed). Also, when such an application starts, it will continue running for a relatively long period of time. Answer the following questions, briefly justifying your answer:<br>
a. Would a packet-switched network or a circuit-switched network be more appropriate for this application? Why?<br>
b. Suppose that a packet-switched network is used and the only traffic in this network comes from such applications as described above. Furthermore, assume that the sum of the application data rates is less than the capacities of
each and every link. Is some form of congestion control
needed? Why?**


答：a.电路交换更适合。因为该应用要以稳定的速率传播，而分组交换无法保证数据传输速率的稳定，并且该应用需要长时间持续传输数据，使用分组交换并不会造成资源利用率低。<br>
b.不需要。因为每条链路的带宽都能同时承担所有应用数据。<br>

**5.Review the car-caravan analogy in Section 1.4. Assume a propagation speed of 100 km/hour.**<br>
**a. Suppose the caravan travels 150 km, beginning in front of one tollbooth, passing through a second tollbooth, and finishing just after a third tollbooth. What is the end-to-end delay?**<br>
**b. Repeat (a), now assuming that there are eight cars in the caravan instead of ten.**

答：a.150/100*2*60+10*12/60=182（min）
时延为182分钟。<br>
b.150/100*2+8*12/60=181.6（min）
时延为181分36秒。<br>

**P6. This elementary problem begins to explore propagation delay and transmission delay, two central concepts in data networking. Consider two hosts A and B, connected by a single link of rate R bps. Suppose that the two hosts are separated by m meters、 and suppose the propagation speed along the link is s meters/sec. Host A is to send a packet of size L bits to Host B.**<br>
**a. Express the propagation delay, dprop, in terms of m and s.**<br>
**b. Determine the transmission time of the packet, dtrans, in terms of L and R．**<br>
**c. Ignoring processing and queuing delays, obtain an expression for the end-to-end delay.**<br>
**d. Suppose Host A begins to transmit the packet at time t = 0. At time t =dtrans, where is the last bit of the packet?**<br>
**e. Suppose dprop is greater than dtrans. At time t = dtrans, where is the first bit of the packet?**<br>
**f. Suppose dprop is less than dtrans. At time t = dtrans, where is the first bit of the packet?**<br>
**g. Suppose s= 2.5&lowast;108, L = 120 bits, and R = 56 kbps. Find the distance m so that dprop equals dtrans.**<br>

答：a.  dprop =m/s<br>
b.  dtrans =L/R<br>
c.  端到端时延t=m/s+L/R<br>
d.  最后一个bit刚离开主机A。<br>
e． 主机A到主机B的中间的链路上。<br>
f． 已经到达主机B。<br>
g． 2.5&lowast;108&lowast;(20/(56&lowast;108))=535714.3(m)
